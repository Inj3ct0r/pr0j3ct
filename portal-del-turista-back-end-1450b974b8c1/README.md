# Back-End

>Based on the tutorials provided by the teacher *Eduardo Diaz*, where we create a RESTFul API using the **PERN** Stack: Postgresql, Express, React and Node.

- "Dynamic" table in sql query (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50399704/nodejs-variable-substitution-for-table-in-sql-query)

Backend for user creation, user get, event and promotion creation and get. It uses different endpoints for our required operations, also we include "dao" files that stores the sql calls in one place so we avoid having to change every file that uses them

BBDD is located in ElephantSQL

Many other functions and methods were obtained from https://stackoverflow.com/ and the order of the code in general was motivated by *Ernesto Oropeza* (Cinetica Consulting Contact) and the assignature's teacher.
```
To use this code, type "npm install" in the terminal while being in the Servidor folder to install all dependencies stored in the package.json file, to run the code type "node index" and it will show the port used for the connection.
```
